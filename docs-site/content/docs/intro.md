# What is Phantom?

**Phantom is the open-source Product Management Operating System for the terminal.**

It connects to any Large Language Model — local or cloud — and transforms it into a structured PM engine capable of generating PRDs, running multi-agent swarm debates, simulating user behavior, and integrating with your entire development tool chain.

## Why Phantom?

Product Managers spend their days context-switching between Notion, Jira, Slack, and Google Docs. Phantom brings PM intelligence directly into the terminal — the same place where engineers live.

| Traditional PM Tools | Phantom |
|---------------------|---------|
| Scattered across 5+ SaaS apps | Single terminal command |
| Manual document writing | AI-generated PRDs, stories, specs |
| Solo decision-making | Multi-agent swarm consensus |
| No integration with dev tools | MCP server for IDE integration |
| Expensive per-seat pricing | Free and open source |

## Core Philosophy

Phantom is built on three principles:

1. **Framework-First Thinking**: Every response applies PM frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Kano, JTBD) automatically.
2. **Model Agnostic**: Connect any LLM — GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, or a local Llama 3 running on your machine.
3. **Terminal Native**: No browser, no GUI, no context switching. Pure CLI productivity.

## Quick Example

```bash
$ phantom

Phantom responds with structured analysis using PM frameworks, not generic AI chatter.
