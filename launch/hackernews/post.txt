Title:
PHANTOM: Open-source PM operating system for the terminal age

Body:
I built PHANTOM to make PM-quality workflows available directly in the terminal.

Current state:
- context indexing from code/docs (Real)
- module system (Real)
- one-line installer pipeline with manifest/checksum (Beta)
- MCP tool contracts for agent/IDE integration (Beta)

Everything is documented with explicit Real/Beta/Planned tags.
