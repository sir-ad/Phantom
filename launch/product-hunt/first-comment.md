Hey Product Hunt! I built PHANTOM because PM and dev workflows were fragmented across tools and context.

PHANTOM is an open-source PM operating system for the terminal:

- one-line install path with checksum validation
- local-first context engine for code/docs
- module system for PM workflows
- swarm analysis for product decisions (Beta)
- MCP core tools for agent/IDE integrations (Beta)

Current status is documented transparently as `Real`, `Beta`, and `Planned` in the repo docs.

Try it:

```bash
curl -fsSL phantom.pm/install | sh
```

Would love your feedback on what to prioritize next.
