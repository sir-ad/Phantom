Owner: PhantomPM PM Team  
Last Updated: 2026-02-13  
Status: Real

## Q1 Theme: Foundation and Truth

Outcomes:

1. docs and capability status system complete
2. build and CLI stability restored
3. baseline test strategy in operation

Milestones:

1. M1: docs system shipped
2. M2: foundation fixes merged
3. M3: reliability release candidate

## Q2 Theme: Installation and Integration Backbone

Outcomes:

1. one-line installer operational
2. release manifest and checksum workflow established
3. MCP core interface contracts shipped

Milestones:

1. M4: installer beta
2. M5: installer stable
3. M6: MCP core baseline

## Q3 Theme: Adapter Ecosystem and Workflow Quality

Outcomes:

1. first adapter set stable (Claude/Codex/Cursor/VS Code path)
2. integration diagnostics mature
3. PM-to-dev workflow outputs more deterministic

Milestones:

1. M7: first adapter GA
2. M8: integration doctor coverage expansion
3. M9: decision-quality improvements

## Q4 Theme: Website, Launch, and Ecosystem Growth

Outcomes:

1. website launch with install-first funnel
2. documentation-driven onboarding scale
3. module and community activation

Milestones:

1. M10: website soft launch
2. M11: public launch campaign
3. M12: post-launch optimization

## Dependencies

1. Q2 depends on Q1 foundation reliability.
2. Q3 depends on Q2 MCP contract stability.
3. Q4 depends on Q1-Q3 truth consistency.

## De-scope Rules

If timeline pressure increases, de-scope in this order:

1. advanced UI polish
2. lower-priority adapters
3. speculative advanced modules

Never de-scope:

1. reliability gates
2. docs truth parity
3. installer safety checks
