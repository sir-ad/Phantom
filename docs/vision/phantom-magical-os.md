# PHANTOM: The Magical PM Operating System

## Purpose

This document captures the aspirational narrative for PHANTOM as a transformational PM operating system.

This is a vision document. Production behavior is defined in `docs/status/*` and `docs/user/*`.

## Vision Statement

PHANTOM turns product management from a specialist discipline into a universal capability. Any builder can run one command and gain structured PM thinking, decision rigor, and execution coordination.

Primary promise:

> You do not need to become a PM to practice PM-quality thinking and delivery.

## The Three Impossibles

1. Install equals instant expertise.
2. Natural language equals full PM orchestration.
3. Any task triggers PM brain augmentation.

## Experience Principles

1. One-line activation:
   - install must feel immediate and trustworthy
   - default path must avoid long setup forms
2. Context-first intelligence:
   - PHANTOM should infer relevant product context from existing artifacts
3. Parallel PM cognition:
   - strategic, analytical, design, technical, research, communication, and operations lenses should run concurrently
4. Local-first trust:
   - privacy control and transparent behavior are table stakes
5. Actionable outputs:
   - every answer should resolve into artifacts and next actions

## Aha Moment Design

The aha moment occurs when a user enters a plain-language product question and PHANTOM outputs:

1. a recommendation
2. an explanation with evidence
3. implementation-ready artifacts
4. coordination-ready communication drafts

Aha quality rubric:

1. speed: under two minutes for first meaningful output
2. confidence: recommendation includes explicit uncertainty and rationale
3. actionability: output can be used by product + engineering immediately

## Narrative Boundaries

This document intentionally uses cinematic framing and evocative language.

Guardrails:

1. This document must not be cited as proof of implemented behavior.
2. Every concrete claim must map to `Real/Beta/Planned` status in capability docs.
3. Marketing copy derived from this doc must pass capability matrix review before publication.

## Product Identity

Brand identity pillars:

1. invisible force
2. matrix-inspired modularity
3. operator control
4. PM-grade discipline for builders
5. practical, not mystical, outcomes

## North-Star Outcome

In two years, PHANTOM is recognized as:

1. the default PM operating layer for engineering-led teams
2. a module ecosystem with community extensibility
3. a bridge between PM intent and developer execution

## Strategic Narrative Themes

1. from reactive shipping to structured product decisions
2. from scattered tools to a coordinated product cockpit
3. from PM bottlenecks to PM-capable teams

## Anti-Hype Standard

To preserve credibility:

1. aspirational copy is allowed
2. ambiguous claims are not allowed
3. implementation state must always be one click away
