# PHANTOM Two-Year Vision

Owner: PhantomPM Leadership Team  
Last Updated: 2026-02-13  
Status: Planned

## Vision Horizon

This document defines where PHANTOM should be in ~24 months if execution quality is high and trust is preserved.

## Desired Position

PHANTOM becomes the default local-first PM operating layer for engineering-driven product teams.

## End-State Characteristics

1. Reliable one-line install on all major developer platforms.
2. Mature MCP-based interoperability with major coding agents and IDEs.
3. Strong module ecosystem with third-party capability extensions.
4. Product decision workflows that are evidence-backed and reproducible.
5. Documentation and capability status always consistent with reality.

## Product Milestones

## Milestone A: Reliability Foundation

1. deterministic core command behavior
2. accurate and enforced capability statuses
3. strong security baseline and auditability

## Milestone B: Integration Standardization

1. MCP core service stable
2. adapters for top coding workflows adopted
3. integration setup under 3 minutes

## Milestone C: Ecosystem Expansion

1. module SDK and policy framework
2. community modules with quality controls
3. marketplace discovery and trust signals

## Milestone D: Portfolio Intelligence

1. multi-product orchestration
2. dependency and risk graphing
3. objective prioritization assistance

## Strategic Moat

1. PM-native cognition expressed through structured agent collaboration
2. local-first trust posture for sensitive product context
3. bridge-layer translation between PM intent and dev execution
4. module extensibility with governance

## Risks

1. Over-claiming before implementation maturity.
2. Integration fragmentation if adapters diverge from core protocol.
3. UX complexity from feature growth.
4. Security posture drifting from stated principles.

## Countermeasures

1. Mandatory status matrix and release gates.
2. MCP-first architecture with adapter conformance checks.
3. Opinionated defaults and progressive disclosure.
4. Security reviews tied to release criteria.

## Long-Range Outcomes

1. Teams treat PHANTOM as daily operating surface, not occasional utility.
2. PM work quality rises across teams without requiring PM headcount parity.
3. Decision-making becomes faster and better-instrumented.
