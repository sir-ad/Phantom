## Our Standard

PHANTOM is an open-source project that values clear communication, technical rigor, and respectful collaboration.

We expect contributors and maintainers to:

1. focus feedback on behavior and code, not people
2. use precise, actionable language
3. assume good intent while still challenging weak technical reasoning
4. avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks

## Unacceptable Behavior

1. abusive or insulting language
2. targeted harassment or intimidation
3. public or private threats
4. deliberate disruption of community discussions

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, issues, PRs, or contributors that violate this code.

Serious or repeated violations may lead to temporary or permanent bans from project spaces.

## Reporting

Report incidents through a GitHub issue marked `security` and mention it concerns community conduct, or contact maintainers directly once the public repo is created.
